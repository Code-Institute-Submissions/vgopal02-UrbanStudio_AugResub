-   ## Design

    -   #### Color Scheme
       Colors have been inspired by the brand logo ( tree of life) and  color palletes obtained from [colorcombos](https://www.colorcombos.com).
       <br>
        <img src="readme/images/wf_color.png" alt="image of color combination" width="700" height="300" img align="center"/>
        <br>
        Final Colors used : rgb(75, 94, 42);rgb(214, 210, 188);rgb(202, 209, 190);rgba(221, 6, 53,);rgb(245, 218, 223); rgb(224, 214, 185);

    -   #### Typography
        -   All headers are in Raleway and Josefin font is the main font used throughout the website. Sans Serif is used the fallback font. Both fonts frequently used on websites, are both attractive and reflective of the brand.Dancing Script has been used in the cover text on the hero image with Sans Serif as the fallback font.

    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. It wants to reflect the studio as a warm, welcoming and sophisticated environment. The large, background hero image is designed to catch the user's attention. It also has a modern, energetic aesthetic without focussing on any one set of people as the organisation wants to appeal to a varied age-range of persons. This has also been reflected in the gallery page where different age range people can be seen.

# Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   ### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.

        - Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean brand logo and social media links. 
        - This is followed by easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. There is a Hero Image with brand text followed by an "About Us Section".        
        - Between the "Hero-Image" and "About Us' section there is also a small arrow which allows users to understand there is more details below the about-us section to which they may go directly.

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content.

        - The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly.
        - Within  the home page as users scroll down for more information , there is a "Join Us" link which is the next point of call should they wish to proceed further . This is to ensure the user does not feel entrapped and always has a link to coonect to without having to scroll back upto the navigation bar.
        - On the Contact Us Page, after a form response is submitted, the page refreshes and the user is brought to the top of the page where the navigation bar is.

    3.  As a First Time Visitor , I want to be able to get a visual feel for the venue.

        - The Gallery page allows the user to get a feel for the studio and surroundings.
        - Images have been carefully curated for the user to experience the studio and different age range of people they may come across.

    4. As a First Time Visitor , I want to be able to contact the organisation to find out more details and join.

        - The Contact Us page allows the user to email the studio. Alternatively , the studio's address and phone contacts also allow them to either plan a visit or call the studio.
        - Within  the home page as users scroll down for more information , there is a "Join Us" link which is the next point of call should they wish to proceed further . This is to ensure the user does not feel entrapped and always has a link to coonect to without having to scroll back upto the navigation bar.
<br>
<br>

 -   ### Returning Visitor Goals

     1.  As a returning visitor , I want to be able to check the current information about type of classes offered and timetable .

         - The site has been designed to make it easy to add and update information and images as required.
            
         - The site has been made robust enough to add more information without changing the layout. This ensures user experience remains consistent and user knows what to expect eveytime they visit the site. 
<br>
<br>

## Further Testing
-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone5, iPhone 6/7/8 & iPhoneX and Android devices.
-   Testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
-   Friends and family members  across global locations  were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.
<br>
<br>

## Design Challenges
- The time-table section of the yoga , pilates and meditation section proved to be challenging to design especially on mobile devices. To ensure the whole timetable section was responsive on smaller devices the font size needed to be made as small as 8px. However , this goes against good practice as suggested by [The Responsive Website font guidelines](https://learnui.design/blog/mobile-desktop-website-font-size-guidelines.html).

- This was solved by creating two flexboxes instead of a single one and dividing the timetable into weekday and weekend sections. On smaller devices the two flex boxes go into a column format allowing the user to get the information clearly.without having to compromise on the font size.
<br>
<br>

## Limitations and Future of the site
- In its current form the site serves the purpose as defined by the organistion - which is to provide and promote to users  information about the organisation's activities .

- Limitations 
    - The lack of technology does not allow the site to be interactive.

- Future

    However, this can be considered as a first step for the organisation. In future with more advanced technology the site can be further developed as:
    - Phase 2 : Adding an interactive time-table and allowing the form to submit information to a database
    - Phase 3 : Adding a backend database allowing users to be able to book  and cancel classes online
    - Phase 4 : Allowing the user to be able to make payment for classes after booking.
