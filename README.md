## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals

        1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.
        2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.
        3. As a First Time Visitor , I want to be able to contact the organisation to find out more details and join.

        -   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
       Colors were inspired by the brand logo ( tree of life) and  color palletes obtained from [colorcombos](https://www.colorcombos.com).
       <br>
        <img src="readme/images/wf_color.png" alt="image of color combination" width="900" height="300" img align="center"/>
        <br>
        Final Colors used : rgb(75, 94, 42);rgb(214, 210, 188);rgb(202, 209, 190);rgba(221, 6, 53,);rgb(245, 218, 223); rgb(224, 214, 185);

    -   #### Typography
        -   All headers are in Raleway and Josefin font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font is not being imported into the site correctly. Both fonts are frequently used on websites, are both attractive and reflective of the brand.Dancing Script has been used in the cover text on the hero image with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font is not being imported into the site correctly .

    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. It wants to reflect the studio as a warm, welcoming and sophisticated environment. The large, background hero image is designed to catch the user's attention. It also has a modern, energetic aesthetic without focussing on any one set of people as the organisation wants to appeal to a varied age-range of persons. This has also been reflected in image gallery where differnt age range people can be seen.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site - learn more about the organisation and what services it offers.

        1. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean brand logo and social media links. 
      
        2. This is followed by easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. There is a Hero Image with brand text followed by an "About Us Section". 
        
        3. Between the "Hero-Image" and "About Us' section there is also a small arrow which indicates to users that there are more details below the about-us section to which they may go directly.

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.

        1. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes the page they will end up at clearly.

        2. As the site in its current state is primarily information based - social media is essential. Therefore, social media links have been placed at the top to allow users to navigate without having to search for them.

        3. Within  the home page as users scroll down for more information , there is a "Join Us" link which is the next point of call should they wish to proceed further . This is to ensure the user does not feel entrapped and always has a link to connect to without having to scroll back upto the navigation bar.

        4. On the Contact Us Page, after a form response is submitted, the page refreshes and the user is brought to the top of the page where the navigation bar is.
   
### Further Testing

-   The Website has been tested on Google Chrome, Firefox and Safari browsers.

-   The website has been viewed on different devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone5, iPhone 6/7/8 & iPhoneX and site has been designed to be responsive on devices with minimum 240px width upto desktop.

-   The website has also been viewed on a variety of different devices through Chrome Developer Tools.

-  Testing has been done to ensure that all pages are linking correctly.

-  Friends and family members  across global locations ( US, India, Singpore and UK) have been asked to review the site and document any bugs and/or user experience issues.


## Deployment

### GitHub Pages

The project has been created on gitpod and deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)

2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.

3. Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.

4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".

5. The page will automatically refresh.

6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site [link](https://vgopal02.github.io/UrbanStudio/index.html) in the "GitHub Pages" section.

## Limitations and Future of the site
- In its current form the site serves the purpose as defined by the organistion - which is to provide and promote to users  information about the organisation's activities .

Limitations 
- The lack of technology does not allow the site to be interactive.

Future

However this can be considered as a first step for the organisation. In future with more advanced technology the site can be further developed as:
- Phase 2 : Adding an interactive time-table and allowing the form to submit information to a database

- Phase 3 : Adding a backend database allowing users to be able to book  and cancel classes online

- Phase 4 : Allowing the user to be able to make payment for classes after booking.
